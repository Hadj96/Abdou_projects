## 2. Category & Product Performance

ðŸŸ¢ High Profitability Subcategories:

- Copiers: 20% of the total profit comes from less 1% of the orders

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:

- Limit or eliminate discounts on high-sales, low-margin items (e.g., Binders)

### States Strong Margin but Low Sales:

  ![GoodMarginBadTotalProfit](Graphs/GoodMarginBadTotalProfit.png)

  
### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:

- Discontinue or revise products with poor margins, especially those frequently discounted
- Launch marketing campaigns in Central & Southern regions to boost order volume
- Offer localized promotions in under-performing areas with sales potential

---

### 6. Discounts vs. Profitability

- Discounts above 20% generally reduce profitability without increasing sales
- Optimal discount level: ~20% (boosts sales effectively)
  
  ![Discount and Profit Trend](<Graphs/Discount And Profit Trend.png>)

  ![Sales Quantity by Discount](<Graphs/Sales Quantity by Discount.png>)
- The largest profit declines from discounting come from Tables, Bookcases, Machines, and especially Binders
  
- Sales consistently show a significant upward trend from August to December in both 2014 and 2017, indicating a strong seasonal pattern likely driven by end-of-year demand, holidays, and promotional periods.
  ![Sales Quantity trend](<Graphs/Sales Quantity trend.png>)

### ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:

- Avoid heavy discounting on low-margin items
- Offer targeted discounts on high-margin, less frequently ordered items (e.g., Copiers) to stimulate sales
